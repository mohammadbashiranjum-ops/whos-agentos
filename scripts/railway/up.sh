#    Agno Railway Setup (first-time provisioning)
#
#    Usage:     ./scripts/railway/up.sh
#    Redeploy:  ./scripts/railway/redeploy.sh
#    Sync env:  ./scripts/railway/env-sync.sh
#    Teardown:  ./scripts/railway/down.sh
#
#    Prerequisites:
#      - Railway CLI installed
#      - Logged in via `railway login`
#      - OPENAI_API_KEY set in environment (or .env / .env.production)
#
#    Optional environment:
#      RAILWAY_WORKSPACE            workspace to create the project in; needed
#                                   non-interactively when the account has more
#                                   than one, since `railway init` would prompt
#      ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_DEPLOY set to 1 to deploy with RUNTIME_ENV=dev,
#                                   which serves the public domain with auth off
#
#    Creates the public domain before deploy, writes it to AGENTOS_URL,
#    generates MCP_CONNECT_SECRET (chat-app OAuth) into the env file when
#    missing, and pauses for JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY/JWT_JWKS_FILE when
#    production auth would otherwise prevent the first deploy from serving.
